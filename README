ABOUT
-----
A tiny and simple "FreeSWITCH" (http://www.freeswitch.org) CDR reporting application.
Designed with Ramaze (http://www.ramaze.net) and Sequel (http://sequel.rubyforge.org), written in Ruby 

 -- BETA: Still under development --


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* ruby (>= 1.8)
* Ramaze (2009.05)
* Innate (2009.05)
* Erubis

USAGE
-----

1) Setup a database to store FreeSWITCH CDR information.

2) Run sequel migration from root of TinyCDR application:
  * sequel 'postgres://tinycdr:awesome_pass@DBSERVER/database' -m db/migrate

  * NOTE:  Change the URI (postgres://tinycdr:awesome_pass@DBSERVER/database) to match your database of course.
           Check http://sequel.rubyforge.org for help

3) Deploy TinyCDR with your prefered Ramaze depolyment methodolies.  (mod_rack, fcgi, mongrel cluster, etc etc)
   http://www.ramaze.net for more details.
   * To just start up you can issue 'ramaze start' in TinyCDR root dir.   This should start TinyCDR at "http://localhost:7000"

4) Now to configure FreeSwitch to use xml_cdr.  From within Freeswitch's root;
   edit conf/autoload_configs/modules.conf.xml and enable mod_xml_cdr

5) Now edit conf/autoload_configs/xml_cdr_conf.xml.  
   Uncomment the 4th line starting with '<param name="url" value=....'.  Insert http://address.to.tinycdr.com/cdr/post for value.
   For example if you deployed TinyCDR by just issuing 'ramaze start' then your line should look like:
   <param name="url" value="http://localhost:7000/cdr/post"/>

6) Restart FreeSWITCH

7) Now go to TinyCDR in your browser (http://localhost:7000 if you simply issue 'ramaze start').  Your CDR information should be available in realtime now.
